----RUST----

>It's Compiled Languague, meaning it will be compiled first into a binary and then exceuted.
>Known for it's own memory management system aka Memory Safe Languague.
>Fast,provides Cocurrency and gives you more control over memory of a system.
>Better than JS because JS compiles and interpret each line of code so less optmize whereas rust precompiles and optimise 
then convert to binary and then run which is generally fasteras there is no overhead or layers in between these process for 
extra checks like in JS. 

--Setup--

>First download and install Rust into your system.
>Then Begin Initialization by creating a new folder in VScode and run cargo init in CMD
>cargo is similar to node in JS, it is the packet manager for rust whoose job is to install and manage third party libraries and comiple rust code.
>After cargo init is exceuted a folder name src and Cargo.toml file is created.
>src folder contains a main.rs file where you write your program code. 
>toml file is just like package.json which helds the information of all the dependencies,metadata and libraries used of the project.
> To run type cargo run
> To optimize for release type cargo build --release

--Extension--

> rust analyzer

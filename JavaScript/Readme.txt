Every Language comes with some set of rules that are made by it's creators and they keep on upgrading or updating or adding these rules.
Your job is not to question the rules because you are not the creator.Your job is to understand these rules.............................
Always think of language as a game , read it's rules, understand them , learn them , apply them and then CREATE.........................
